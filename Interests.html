        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <p>I am full of love and admiration for everything, but some of my most passionate interests are... 
            <ul>
                <li>spending time with my family</li>
                <li>school</li>
                <li>music</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Spending time with family</h3>

            <p>I come from a pretty big family, I once tried to count all of my cousins and I got a number in the 90's. My best friends are my siblings and my <a href="me,grandma,grandpa.jpg">grandparents</a>. One of my favorite things that we would all do together is go to KFC on Tuesdays and get their <i>Tuesday Special</i>.
            My grandpa was <strong>Mountain Dews biggest fan</strong>, so now I absolutely worship Mountain Dew. 
        I have 2 nephews and 3 nieces and my heart is fully taken with them, I love goofing around with them and being their "second mom".</p>
