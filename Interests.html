        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <p>I am full of love and admiration for everything, but some of my most passionate interests are... 
            <ul>
                <li>spending time with my family</li>
                <li>school</li>
                <li>music</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Spending time with family</h3>

            <p>
                I come from a pretty big family, I once tried to count all of my cousins and I got a number in the 90's. My best friends are my siblings and my <a href="me,grandma,grandpa.jpg">grandparents</a>. One of my favorite things that we would all do together is go to KFC on Tuesdays and get their <i>Tuesday Special</i>.
            My grandpa was <strong>Mountain Dews biggest fan</strong>, so now I absolutely worship Mountain Dew. 
        I have 2 nephews and 3 nieces and my heart is fully taken with them, I love goofing around with them and being their "second mom".
            </p>
        <h3>School</h3>

            <p> 
                One of the things that suprises people the most when I tell them is that, I absolutely adore attending school. It stresses me out beyond belief, but I find it to be <i>so</i> worth it.
                I love learning new things and being able to prove myself wrong. A lot of students dont enjoy school, which is completely understandable, but for some odd reason, it makes me feel like I have something to look forward to.
                I am really proud of my abilities at school and I'm betting thats why I enjoy it.
            </p>
        <h3>Music</h3>
            <img src="concert.JPG" alt="concert photo" height="150" width="175">
            <p>
              If there's been anything that's stayed a constant for the past couple years, it would be my admiration of music. I think that I've always loved listening to music, but in the last couple years I've really come to appriciate the art that it is.
              This includes my love for concerts, there are very little things I enjoy more than dancing at a concert with people I love listening to artists that I love.
